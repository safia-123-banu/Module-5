## Hierarchical Inheritance

---

### AIM  
To write a Python program to get the employee and doctor details and display them using hierarchical inheritance. Create a parent (base) class named `Details` and two child (derived) classes named `Employee` and `Doctor`.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. **Begin the program.**
2. **Create a class Details** with an `__init__` method to initialize three attributes: `id`, `name`, and `gender`.
3. **Define a method display_details()** to print the values of `id`, `name`, and `gender`.
4. **Create a class Employee** that inherits from the `Details` class. 
   - Add two additional attributes: `company` and `department`.
   - Override the `display_details()` method to print the employee-specific attributes (`company` and `department`) along with the inherited details.
5. **Create a class Doctor** that also inherits from the `Details` class. 
   - Add two additional attributes: `hospital` and `department`.
   - Override the `display_details()` method to print the doctor-specific attributes (`hospital` and `department`) along with the inherited details.
6. **Accept input** for employee and doctor details.
7. **Create objects of Employee and Doctor** using the input.
8. **Call the `display_details()` method** for both objects to print the details.
9. **Terminate the program.**

### PROGRAM
```
class A:
def data(self):
self.idd = int(input())
self.name = input()
self.gen = input()
self.comp = input()
self.dept = input()
class B(A):
def display1(self):
A.data(self)
print("Employee Object")
print("Id: ",self.idd)
print("Name: ",self.name)
print("Gender: ",self.gen)
print("Company: ",self.comp)
print("Department: ",self.dept)
print("")
class C(B):
def display2(self):
A.data(self)
print("Doctor Object")
print("Id: ",self.idd)
print("Name: ",self.name)
print("Gender: ",self.gen)
print("Hospital: ",self.comp)
print("Department: ",self.dept)
obj = C()
objj = B()
objj.display1()
obj.display2()

```
